As the atomic radius increases, the outer electrons are farther from the nucleus, reducing the attraction between them and the nucleus. This makes it easier to remove an electron, resulting in lower ionization energy. Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons. Atomic mass is the sum of protons and neutrons, with minor contributions from electrons. Electron a \ufb03 nity measures the attraction between an incoming electron and the nucleus, with stronger attraction releasing more energy."

                "explanation": "Antoine Lavoisier, known as the \"Father of Modern Chemistry,\" disproved the existence of phlogiston and helped to form the basis of modern chemistry using Joseph Priestley's discovery of oxygen. The phlogiston theory postulated the existence of a \ufb01r e-like element dubbed phlogiston contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. It was \ufb01rst pr oposed by Johann Joachim Becher."
