When a moving charged particle enters a magnetic \ufb01eld then the path followed by the charged particle is circular if the magnetic \ufb01eld is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. More the radius of the path followed by the particle, the lesser will be the curvature, and the lesser the radius, the more will be curvature.
