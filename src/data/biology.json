Matriculation Level 26/06/2024 (Shift - 1) (a) Golgi (b) ER (c) Lysosome (d) Mitochondria Sol.177.(d) Mitochondria. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a process where cells die through a series of molecular steps. Mitochondria play a crucial role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) by releasing cytochrome c, which triggers the activation of caspases, the enzymes that execute the cell death process. Q.178 .

Saliva is mainly produced by three pairs of salivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the submaxillary or submandibular (lower jaw) and the sub-linguals (below the tongue). These glands situated just outside the buccal cavity secrete salivary juice into the buccal cavity. Q.179 . What are ribosomes made up of? Higher Secondary 26/06/2024 (Shift - 2) (a) Only RNA (b) Only proteins (c) Only DNA (d) Proteins and RNA Sol.179.(d) Proteins and RNA. Ribosomes are cell organelles involved in protein synthesis, earning them the name 'protein factories.' They consist of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and approximately 40 to 80 proteins, which provide structural support. Ribosomes have two subunits: large and small. The subunits remain separate when not synthesizing proteins and come together during the process of protein synthesis."

                "answer": "d",
                "explanation": "Muscle cells are specialized cells that can contract and relax. This ability is crucial for movement in the body. When muscle cells contract, they shorten, which pulls on the bones or other structures they are attached to, causing movement. When they relax, they lengthen and return to their original state. This cycle of contraction and relaxation is what allows for various movements, such as walking, lifting objects, or even the beating of the heart."
